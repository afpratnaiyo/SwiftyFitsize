You can use the chat system to coordinate your attacks, request backup, warn about enemies, or share information. You can also use the voice chat feature if you have a microphone and headphones. Communication is key to winning in FreeFall Tournament.
- Upgrade your skills and equipment. As you play FreeFall Tournament, you will earn credits and experience points that you can use to upgrade your skills and equipment. You can increase your health, damage, speed, accuracy, and other attributes by spending credits on skill points.
