In this article, we will show you how to use the SAILI Simulator Launcher to create and run a simulation for a self-driving car. You will learn how to:
 
- Install and launch the SAILI Simulator Launcher
- Select a simulation environment and a vehicle model
- Configure the simulation parameters and the AI model
- Start and monitor the simulation
- Analyze the simulation results and feedback

By the end of this article, you will be able to use the SAILI Simulator Launcher to train and evaluate your AI models in realistic scenarios.
  
## Install and launch the SAILI Simulator Launcher
 
The SAILI Simulator Launcher is a software application that you can download and install on your computer. You can find the download link and the installation instructions on the official website of SAILI. Once you have installed the SAILI Simulator Launcher, you can launch it by double-clicking on its icon on your desktop or in your applications folder.
 
When you launch the SAILI Simulator Launcher, you will see a welcome screen that shows you the available simulation environments and vehicle models. You can browse through them and select the ones that suit your needs. You can also create your own custom environments and models by using the SAILI Editor, which is a separate tool that you can access from the SAILI Simulator Launcher.
  
## Select a simulation environment and a vehicle model
 
After you have selected the simulation environment and the vehicle model, you can click on the "Next" button to proceed to the simulation configuration screen. Here, you can adjust the simulation parameters and the AI model that you want to use for your self-driving car.
 
The simulation parameters include the weather conditions, the traffic density, the road layout, the speed limit, and other factors that affect the simulation. You can choose from a range of predefined settings or create your own custom settings. You can also save and load your simulation settings for future use.
 
The AI model is the core of your self-driving car. It is the algorithm that controls the steering, acceleration, braking, and other actions of your vehicle. You can choose from a list of pre-trained AI models that are compatible with the SAILI Simulator Launcher or upload your own AI model. You can also modify and fine-tune your AI model by using the SAILI Model Editor, which is another separate tool that you can access from the SAILI Simulator Launcher.
  
## Start and monitor the simulation
 
Once you have configured the simulation parameters and the AI model, you can click on the "Start" button to launch the simulation. The SAILI Simulator Launcher will open a new window that shows you a 3D view of your simulation environment and your vehicle. You can also see a dashboard that displays various information about your vehicle's status, such as speed, position, sensors, cameras, etc.
 
You can monitor the simulation in real-time or pause and resume it at any time. You can also change the camera angle and zoom in and out to get different perspectives of your simulation. You can also interact with your simulation by using your keyboard or mouse to control your vehicle manually or to trigger events such as obstacles, pedestrians, traffic lights, etc.
 
The SAILI Simulator Launcher will record and save all the data from your simulation, such as images, videos, logs, metrics, etc. You can access this data from the SAILI Data Viewer, which is another separate tool that you can access from the SAILI Simulator Launcher.
